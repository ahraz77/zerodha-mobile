# Stock API Integration Solution

## Problem
The application was encountering CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to fetch real stock market data from Yahoo Finance API directly from the browser:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Vite Proxy Configuration
Added proxy configuration in `vite.config.js` to route API requests through the development server:

```javascript
server: {
  port: 3000,
  open: true,
  proxy: {
    '/api/yahoo': {
      target: 'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api\/yahoo/, ''),
      headers: {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
      }
    },
    '/api/yahoo-chart': {
      target: 'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api\/yahoo-chart/, ''),
      headers: {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Stock API Service
Modified `src/services/stockAPI.js` to use proxy endpoints:

- **Before**: `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance`
- **After**: `/api/yahoo/v7/finance`

This routes requests through the Vite development server, which handles CORS properly.

### 3. Enhanced Fallback System
Implemented a comprehensive fallback system with realistic Indian stock market data:

#### Features:
- **Market-aware pricing**: Different volatility based on market hours
- **Realistic volumes**: Based on actual stock popularity patterns
- **Proper market cap and P/E ratios**: For major Indian stocks
- **Time-sensitive data**: Reduced volatility outside market hours
- **Upward bias**: Slight positive trend to simulate real market behavior

#### Stocks Covered:
- **Indices**: SENSEX, NIFTY 50
- **Major Stocks**: RELIANCE, TCS, HDFCBANK, INFY, ICICIBANK, etc.
- **Complete data**: Price, change, volume, market cap, P/E ratio

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when Yahoo Finance is unavailable
- Console logging for debugging
- Maintains app functionality even without internet

## Usage

The system now automatically:
1. **Tries** to fetch real data from Yahoo Finance via proxy
2. **Falls back** to enhanced mock data if API fails
3. **Provides** realistic Indian stock market data in both cases

## Benefits

1. **CORS Resolved**: No more browser blocking issues
2. **Reliable**: Works with or without internet connection
3. **Realistic**: Enhanced mock data mirrors real market patterns
4. **Production Ready**: Proxy can be configured for production deployment
5. **Indian Market Focus**: Tailored for NSE/BSE stocks

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the portfolio or chart pages
3. Check browser console for API logs
4. Buy/sell functionality should work without CORS errors

## Production Deployment

For production, consider:
1. Setting up a backend proxy server
2. Using official APIs with proper authentication
3. Implementing caching for better performance
4. Rate limiting to avoid API abuse

## Notes

- Yahoo Finance API is unofficial and may have limitations
- Enhanced mock data provides consistent experience during development
- Real-time updates work properly with the new system
- All existing functionality (charts, orders, portfolio) remains intact
